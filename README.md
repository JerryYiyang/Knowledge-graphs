# The Study of Knowledge Graphs and their potential application in Firebase
A personal research project regarding knowledge graphs.

Abstract:
	This project aims to study knowledge graphs - to understand how they work, how they may be improved, and how they may be potentially applied to Firebase. The reason is to further my own knowledge regarding knowledge graphs as well as to the potential benefit and optimization of data for the AI for Search & Rescue research team. Research was conducted on knowledge graphs, and then a knowledge graph was developed using the “Wildland Search and Rescue Missions by NYS Forest Rangers beginning 2012” database (Data.ny.gov). Finally, research was done to determine if knowledge graphs can be used in Firebase.
